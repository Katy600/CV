## Katy McCann
I am a full-stack junior developer, recent graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) Europe's leading web development bootcamp, and former primary school teacher.

As a teacher, I am adept at researching new material, communicating ideas effectively and designing and planning visual and interactive learning experiences, all of which are transferrable to software development.

My drive to learn how to code was initially fuelled by a web app idea as an aid for teachers. This project led me to seek out online resources such as Codeacademy and get involved in Meetup groups including Codebar.

I am now looking for a full stack junior developer role in a vibrant company with a culture of paired coding and shared knowledge in which I can continue to learn to my full capacity.

## Skills
#### Communication skills
As a teacher I develop skills such as being able to:
- Break down challenging concepts for a range of ages and levels.
-  Share lesson plans effectively with colleagues.
-  Deliver pupil feedback to parents in a professional yet approachable manner.

At Makers I developed effective pairing skills and was able to:
- Break down ideas and problems
through discussion and diagramming.
- Take regular turns to navigate and drive.
- Support each other in our differing ideas and stay open to change.

#### Collaboration
As part of a team within a school led me to value practices such as:
- Regular planning meetings which create a sense of purpose and focus.
- A culture of sharing resources, ideas, honest reflections and a mutual desire to improve our practice through creative and solution based approaches.

During project week at Makers we:
- Held regular stand-ups and retros.
- Used Waffle to support us in managing our issues, achieve our MVP and manage our work flow effectively.

#### Rising to new challenges
Teaching is a dynamic and agile profession which is constantly changing. Consequently I:
- Taught the new IT curriculum, introducing children to HTML, coding with the software 'Scratch', investigating the internet and editing a Wiki page.
- Learned and implemented new pedagogical approaches.
- Adapted to the continual revision of the curriculum.

During Makers:
- Our final project involved learning Xcode and Swift 3 in order to build a realtime, multiplayer drawing game in just 2 weeks.
