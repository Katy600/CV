## Katy McCann
I am a full-stack junior developer, recent graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and former primary school teacher.
From teacher to coder seemed at first, an unlikely transition but now in retrospect it was meant to be.

Researching new material, communicating ideas effectively, designing visual and interactive learning experiences with the use of interactive whiteboards as well as the creative process of planning lessons, all now seem to align perfectly with my experience of evolving myself into a software developer.

My drive to learn how to code was initially fuelled by an idea that I really wanted to create and this led me to stumble upon online resources, such as Code Academy and to eventually discover the Meetup group Code-bar.

I am now looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role in a vibrant company with a culture of paired coding, shared knowledge and where I can continue to learn to my full capacity.

## Skills
#### Communication skills
Communication is a key component of teaching and spans a multitude of levels.
-  Being able to break down challenging concepts.
-  Communicating lesson plans with colleagues.
-  Talking with parents on both a professional level whilst being approachable.


#### Collaboration
Working with colleagues who have a mutual desire to share resources, ideas, struggles and solutions has always elevated my enjoyment for my job, challenging me to take on new approaches, new ways of seeing things as well as the overall feeling of shared success.

#### Taking on new challenges
Teaching is a dynamic and agile profession which is constantly changing. During my 8 years of teaching I had to take on:
- New pedagogical approaches.
- Continual revisions to the curriculum.
- Keep up-to-date with the new IT curriculum, introducing children to HTML; coding with the software 'Scratch'; investigating the internet and editing a Wiki page.
