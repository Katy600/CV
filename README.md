## Katy McCann
I am a full stack junior developer, recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and former primary school teacher.

As a teacher, I was adept at researching new material, communicating ideas effectively and designing and planning visual and interactive learning experiences, all of which are transferrable to software development.

My drive to learn how to code was initially fuelled by *can you sum up this idea in 5 words or less* and this led me to seek out online resources such as Codecademy and get involved with Meetup groups including codebar.

I am now looking for a full stack junior developer role in a vibrant company with a culture of paired coding and sharing knowledge in which I can continue to learn to my full capacity.

## Skills
#### Communication skills
-  Break down challenging concepts for a range of ages and levels.
-  Share lesson plans effectively with colleagues.
-  Deliver pupil feedback to parents in a professional yet approachable manner. *maybe say more here about being able to give negative feedback in a way that challenges and encouges???*


#### Collaboration
*This paragraph doesn't say much aside from that you enjoyed doing it and it helped you...try to say what you did and how it helped other people, like above - look at the SMART stuff Zara was talking about*
Working with colleagues who have a mutual desire to share resources, ideas, struggles and solutions has always elevated my enjoyment for my job, challenging me to take on new approaches, new ways of seeing things as well as the overall feeling of shared success.

#### Rising to new challenges
Teaching is a dynamic and agile profession which is constantly changing. Consequently I:
- Taught the new IT curriculum, introducing children to HTML; coding with the software 'Scratch'; investigating the internet and editing a Wiki page.
- Learned and implemented new pedagogical approaches.
- *Dealt with - think of a word which sounds less like it was forced upon you (even though I know it was!) and more like you mastered it* continual revisions to the curriculum.
